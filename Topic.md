# Overview
- Understand and be able to apply advanced concepts of the C programming language to create advanced C applications.
- Understand Function and Double Pointers, Recursion, Bit Manipulation, Macros, Signals and loads more (check curriculam on this page for full list).
- Learn all about threads and networking with Sockets.
- Master the art of problem solving in programming using efficient, proven methods.
- Be able to apply advanced C concepts to other programming languages.
- How to write high quality C code to make yourself more marketable for senior programming positions and be apply for real-time/embedded programming positions.
# Standards
## C99 Standard:
bool datatype - stdbool.h (added true/false keywords)
variable Length arrays
single line comments
C11: header file: <threads.h>
- multi threading support, safe standard support.
- the standard also attempts to fix some issues presented in C99
## example C89 standards:
int i;
for(i=0;i<n;i++)

## example c99 standards:
for( int i=0;i<n;i++)

## example c11 standards:

begin or end with _s (strcat_s, strcpy_s)

C89 is most widely used so focus on that

# Learning Objectives
- course include Threads, Function Pointers, Double Pointers, Recursion, Networking using Sockets, Bit manipulation, Macros, Signals, Storage Classes and loads more.  Check the curriculum on this page for full details of what is included in this very comprehensive course.

- By the end of this course, with your new-found skills, you will be able to apply for real-time/embedded C programming positions or any job that requires mastery of the C programming language and be able to apply your new skills developing your own Advanced C programs.
